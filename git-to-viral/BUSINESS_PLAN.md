# Business Plan: Git-to-Viral

## 1. Problem
Developers and Open Source maintainers spend hours building great tools but struggle to promote them. Writing blog posts and social media threads is tedious and often neglected.

## 2. Solution
**Git-to-Viral** is a "Content Engine for Devs". It analyzes a GitHub repository and automatically generates high-quality technical content:
- 📝 Detailed Blog Post (Markdown)
- 🧵 Viral Twitter Thread
- 👔 Professional LinkedIn Post

## 3. Monetization Strategy
- **Freemium (CLI)**: Open source CLI tool for individual developers (generates basic templates).
- **Pro ($9/mo)**: Web UI with:
  - **Auto-Post**: Schedule tweets directly.
  - **AI Analysis**: Deep code understanding using GPT-4/Gemini to write *better* blogs.
  - **Custom Branding**: Add your own logo/footer.
- **Enterprise ($499/mo)**: "DevRel Team in a Box" for companies with multiple open source projects.

## 4. Marketing Plan
- **Launch**: Product Hunt + Hacker News "Show HN".
- **Content**: Use the tool *on itself* to generate viral threads about Git-to-Viral.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with DevRel influencers.

## 5. Roadmap
- **Week 1 (MVP)**: Basic CLI with heuristic analysis. (✅ Done by Night Shift)
- **Week 2**: Add real `git clone` and `package.json` parsing.
- **Week 4**: Web UI launch.
