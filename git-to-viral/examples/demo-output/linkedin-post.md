🔥 New Project Discovery: openclaw-projects

I recently dove into the source code of openclaw-projects, an impressive Node.js application.

Key Highlights:
- Modern stack: Node.js, React, Docker
- Clean architecture with Medium complexity.

If you're a developer looking to learn Node.js, this repo is a goldmine.
